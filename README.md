### Chapter 16 - Bluetooth Low Energy

Using [Puck.js](http://www.puck-js.com/) to count the number of times a door has opened and transmit it over Bluetooth Low Energy.

* [Experiment 34 Espruino JavaScript](experiment34.js)
* [Experiment 34 HTML](experiment34.html)
* [Experiment 35](experiment35.js)
* [Experiment 36 Espruino JavaScript](experiment36.js)
* [Experiment 36 HTML](experiment36.html)

**Note:** Google has shut down some features that were used for Experiment 35:

* [Eddystone notifications are now disabled](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2018/10/discontinuing-support-for-android.html)
because of abuse by advertisers, so Eddystone devices will no longer appear as Android Notifications.
* The [goo.gl URL shortener is shutting down](https://developers.googleblog.com/2018/03/transitioning-google-url-shortener.html)
so you'll need to use something like [bit.ly](https://bitly.com/) instead.
